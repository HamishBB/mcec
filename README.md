## Overview

MCE Controller is a Windows application enabling Windows PCs to be controlled by home automation systems. 
It runs in the background and receives commands from a home automation system (such as Control4) over the network (or serial port). 
It then translates those commands into actions such as keystrokes, text input, and the starting of programs. 

Any home automation system, control system, or application that can send text strings via TCP/IP or a serial port can use MCE Controller to control a Windows PC.

MCE Controller was originally written in 2004 to enable integration of a Windows Media Center Edition (hence the name "MCE Controller") based home theater PC (HTPC) into a Crestron whole-house audio/video system. It has been continually improved since and is general enough that others have used it with other control systems such as Control4, Creston, Home Assistant, and Home Seer. Anything that supports sending or receivng text strings to a TCP/IP port can work.
